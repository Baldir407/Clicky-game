# React Click Game

This is a quick memory game made in React called

#KLICKY KOMBAT

The player is shown nine characters from the Mortal Kombat series of video games. After clicking on one, they must be able to click
on the other nine without clicking on the same character twice. If they do, they fail and their score is reset with their highest score logged.
There is no win state currently, however. I did not have enough time when making this to implement it.
